## [1.2.2] - 2025-09-20

### ðŸ”§ Critical Bug Fix

#### Fixed
- **Issue #10: Multiple Filter Data Accuracy** - Fixed critical data accuracy issue where filtered queries returned incorrect user counts
  - **Root Cause**: When users applied filters, they received daily breakdowns instead of properly aggregated period totals
  - **Solution**: Improved aggregation logic to return deduplicated user counts matching GA4 browser interface
  - **Impact**: Multiple filters (3+) now return accurate data identical to GA4 browser results
  - **Verification**: Comprehensive testing with 3, 4, and 5 filter combinations across multiple date ranges

#### Added
- **Python 3.13 Support** - Added official support for Python 3.13.x
  - Tested and verified compatibility with latest Python version
  - Maintains full backward compatibility with Python 3.10-3.12

#### Technical Details
- **User Deduplication**: Fixed improper summation of daily user counts across time periods
- **Server-Side Aggregation**: Leverages GA4 API's proper aggregation when date dimension is not present
- **Filter Complexity**: Verified that filter complexity (3, 4, 5+ filters) doesn't affect accuracy
- **Browser Parity**: All filtered results now match GA4 browser interface exactly

### ðŸ“Š Verification Results
- âœ… 3 Filters (US+Desktop+Chrome): Accurate across all date ranges
- âœ… 4 Filters (+New York): Accurate across all date ranges  
- âœ… 5 Filters (+Windows): Accurate across all date ranges
- âœ… All results verified against GA4 browser interface

## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-24

### ðŸš€ Major Performance Enhancements

#### Added
- **Smart Data Volume Management**
  - Automatic row count estimation before data fetching
  - Interactive warning system for queries returning >2,500 rows
  - Specific optimization suggestions to reduce data volume
  - `estimate_only` parameter to get row counts without fetching data

- **Server-Side Processing Optimizations**
  - Intelligent server-side aggregation using GA4's `MetricAggregation.TOTAL`
  - Smart sorting with `OrderBy` parameters (recent dates first, highest values first)
  - Automatic aggregation detection for queries without date dimensions

- **Enhanced User Control Parameters**
  - `proceed_with_large_dataset` - Override warnings for large datasets
  - `limit` - Set maximum number of rows to return
  - `enable_aggregation` - Control server-side aggregation behavior
  - `estimate_only` - Get row estimates without data fetching

- **Response Metadata & Transparency**
  - Applied optimizations tracking in response metadata
  - Total vs returned row counts when limits are applied
  - Clear indicators when aggregation or sorting is applied

#### Changed
- Updated FastMCP dependency to `>=2.0.0` for better performance
- Enhanced `get_ga4_data` function with backward-compatible optimization parameters
- Improved error handling with graceful degradation when optimizations fail

#### Fixed
- **Context Window Crash Prevention** - Eliminates crashes from large datasets
- **Memory Usage Optimization** - Reduces memory footprint for large queries
- **API Rate Limit Management** - Better handling of GA4 API quotas

### ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements
- Added helper functions `_get_smart_sorting()` and `_should_aggregate()`
- Enhanced response formatting with metadata for transparency
- Improved error messages and debugging information

### ðŸ“š Documentation
- Added comprehensive optimization features section to README
- Updated usage examples with optimization scenarios
- Added troubleshooting guide for large dataset handling

## [1.0.11] - Previous Release
- Base functionality with 200+ GA4 dimensions and metrics
- Core MCP server implementation
- Basic data retrieval capabilities

### Migration Guide

**From v1.0.x to v1.2.0:**

No breaking changes! All existing queries will continue to work exactly as before. New optimization features are automatically enabled with sensible defaults.

**New Features You Can Use:**
```python
# Get row count estimate before fetching
get_ga4_data(dimensions=["city", "date"], estimate_only=True)

# Override warnings for large datasets
get_ga4_data(dimensions=["city", "date"], proceed_with_large_dataset=True)

# Set custom row limits
get_ga4_data(dimensions=["city"], limit=100)

# Disable automatic aggregation
get_ga4_data(dimensions=["month"], enable_aggregation=False)
```
